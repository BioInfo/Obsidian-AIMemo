- **Time**: 11:24 - 11:47
- **Phase**: Phase 3 - Cross-Platform Optimization
- **Developer**: Roo

## Session Summary
### Goals
- [x] Improve code organization and maintainability
- [x] Enhance performance monitoring
- [x] Implement better error handling
- [x] Add memory management

### Progress
1. Accomplished Tasks
   - Refactored code into manager-based architecture
   - Created base worker class for common functionality
   - Implemented performance monitoring utilities
   - Enhanced error handling with specific types
   - Added memory management and tracking
   - Improved TypeScript type safety

2. Challenges Encountered
   - Fixed circular dependencies in settings management
   - Resolved TypeScript build issues with ES2022
   - Improved null handling in worker communication
   - Enhanced error propagation across components

3. Code Changes
   - Created new manager classes:
     - UiManager for UI elements
     - CommandManager for plugin commands
     - SettingsManager for configuration
   - Added worker utilities:
     - WhisperWorkerMonitor for performance tracking
     - WhisperModelHandler for model lifecycle
     - BaseWorker for common functionality
   - Enhanced error handling:
     - Added ErrorHandler utility
     - Improved error types and codes
     - Better error propagation

## Files Modified
- `src/main.ts`: Refactored to use manager classes
- `src/managers/`: Added new manager implementations
- `src/workers/`: Added worker utilities and base class
- `src/utils/`: Added error handling utilities
- `docs/`: Updated documentation
- `tsconfig.json`: Fixed ES2022 compatibility

## Decisions Made
1. Architecture Changes
   - Moved to manager-based architecture for better separation of concerns
   - Created base worker class to reduce code duplication
   - Implemented centralized error handling
   - Added performance monitoring utilities

2. Performance Improvements
   - Added memory usage tracking
   - Implemented progress reporting
   - Enhanced resource cleanup
   - Added configurable memory limits

## Next Steps
1. Priority Tasks
   - [ ] Complete automated testing setup
   - [ ] Add platform-specific tests
   - [ ] Implement performance benchmarks
   - [ ] Create stress testing scenarios

2. Future Considerations
   - Further performance optimizations
   - Enhanced error recovery
   - Additional platform-specific improvements
   - Mobile optimization

## Notes
- Following modular architecture principles
- Focusing on performance and reliability
- Improving cross-platform compatibility
- Enhancing developer experience
