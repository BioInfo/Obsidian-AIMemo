  - Provides robust tooling and IDE support
  - Enables better code organization and maintainability

### Obsidian Integration
- **Obsidian Plugin API**
  - Core framework for plugin development
  - Provides access to vault operations
  - Enables integration with Obsidian's features

### Audio Processing
- **Web Audio API**
  - Native browser API for audio recording
  - Provides low-level audio processing capabilities
  - Enables cross-platform audio capture

## Backend Tools

### Transcription Engine
- **OpenAI Whisper**
  - Options for both local and API-based processing
  - Supports multiple languages
  - Provides high accuracy transcription
  - Configurable for different accuracy/speed trade-offs

### AI Processing
- **OpenAI GPT (Future Enhancement)**
  - Text summarization capabilities

## Database

### Local Storage
- **Obsidian Vault System**
  - File-based storage within user's vault
  - Markdown files for notes and metadata
  - Binary storage for audio files
  - Structured folder hierarchy for organization

## Architectural Decisions

### 1. Local-First Architecture
**Decision**: Implement core functionality to work offline by default
**Justification**:
- Ensures privacy and data security
- Reduces dependency on external services
- Provides better performance for basic operations
- Aligns with Obsidian's philosophy

### 2. Modular Design
**Decision**: Separate core functionalities into independent modules
**Justification**:
- Enables easier maintenance and updates
- Allows for flexible deployment options
- Simplifies testing and debugging
- Facilitates future feature additions

### 3. Event-Driven Architecture
**Decision**: Use event-driven pattern for plugin operations
**Justification**:
- Better integration with Obsidian's event system
- Improved responsiveness and user experience
- Easier state management
- More flexible error handling

### 4. Progressive Enhancement
**Decision**: Implement features in layers of increasing complexity
**Justification**:
- Ensures core functionality is always available
- Allows for optional advanced features
- Better handles varying system capabilities
- Improves user experience across platforms

### 5. Security-First Approach
**Decision**: Implement strong security measures from the start
**Justification**:
- Protects sensitive audio and transcription data
- Ensures user privacy
- Builds trust with users
- Reduces security-related technical debt
